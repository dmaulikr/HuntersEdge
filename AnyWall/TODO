4) Add support for multiple types of pin drops X
	- Green = Currently viewed pin notes X
	- Red = Recently added Animal (<30 mins? 1 hr?) X (Still need to add timer)
	- Purple = Animal spotted (1+ hours ago)
	- Blue (Dot) = current user location X
	- Yellow (Dots)  = Other user location
	- Black = General note pin
5) Add compass to MapView (figure out how to do this)?
6) Have Brittni make:
	- App Icon
	- UITabBar images
		- Journal  (book)
		- Map (pin marker)
		- Group Chat ( ??? Multiple people like Fitivity?)
		- Settings (gear)
	-Logo
	- Splash screen
	- Any other custom images?  Buttons?  
7)Add group chat functionality (In progress)
8) Wednesday - Discuss 
	- Possibilities of profile page?
	- Ditch alarm clock functionality? (Built-in phone, keep app simple)
	- Journal pages as a UITableView (List) instead of a page flip
		-This is more efficient, can see all entries in a single table
		-Can probably still have flip functionality 
			-by utilizing UIGestureSwipeRecognizer
9) Add login with Facebook functionality
